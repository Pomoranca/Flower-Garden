# Flower Garden

Flower Garden is an app that shows flower images with detailed preview. Flowers are stored on a Web server as a REST web service. This app demonstrated the use of Retrofit to make REST requests to the web service, Moshi to handle the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects, and Glide to load and cache images by URL.

The app also leverages ViewModel, LiveData, Data Binding with binding adapters, and Navigation with the SafeArgs plugin for parameter passing between fragments.
